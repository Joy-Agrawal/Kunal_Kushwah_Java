public class TimeComplexity {
    //Time complexity != Time Taken
    // Time complexity is a function that tells us how the time is going to grow as the input size grows
//    what do we consider when looking for complexity
//    1 always look for worst case complexity
//    2. always look for large/ infinite data
//    Big oh Notation :  it tells the upper bound for any problem
//    Big Omega : it tells the lower bound for any problem ; it is opposite of Big Oh notation
//        Theta Notation : it is the combination of Big Oh and Big Omega Notation
//    Little Oh : this also tells about the upper bound , but it is not strict , or we can say it is loose upper bound
//For Ex: -> Big oh: f = O(g)
//                      => f <=g
//    Little oh : f = o(g)
//                    =>  f < g , i.e strictly

//    Little omega : this also tells about the lower bound , but it is not strict , or we can say it is loose lower bound
//For Ex: -> Big omega: f = O(g)
//                      => f >=g
//    Little Omega : f = o(g)
//                    =>  f > g , i.e strictly
